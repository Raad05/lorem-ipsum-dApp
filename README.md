# Lorem Ipsum
Lorem Ipsum is a national blockchain-driven private cloud-based platform for Bangladesh, specifically designed for healthcare administration. This platform is built with the goal of providing a secure and decentralized system for healthcare data management, ensuring patient privacy and security.

Tech Stack
The tech stack used for this project includes:

## Frontend
- ReactJS
- React-router
- Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI
## Backend
- Hyperledger Firefly for Decentralized data
- Solidity for Smart Contracts

This combination of technologies enables us to build a robust and scalable platform that leverages the benefits of blockchain technology to ensure transparency and immutability of data. With ReactJS as our frontend framework, we can create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for healthcare providers and patients. React-router helps us to handle client-side routing efficiently, while Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI provides a set of customizable and responsive UI components to build a modern-looking interface.

On the backend, we use Hyperledger Firefly to ensure a decentralized and secure data management system. Hyperledger Firefly is a distributed ledger technology that provides privacy, security, and scalability for enterprise-grade applications. We also use Solidity for writing smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain. These smart contracts ensure the immutability of data, automate processes, and provide an additional layer of security.




# Getting Started with Create React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
